## Sparkler - A Reference API Microservice based on Spark

In 2002, Clinton Begin released [JPetStore](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=14243), "a completely rewritten Pet Store application based on Sun's original J2EE Pet Store." For those who don't remember, developing web applications in the early 2000's was a debacle based on J2EE and EJB's. Spring hadn't yet been released, and simple examples of Java web applications like JPetStore were in short supply.

Now nearly 15 years later, in the spirit of JPetStore, Sparkler demonstrates a simple, microservices-based approach to build, test, deploy, and monitor a small API server that allows you to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE simple domain objects.

### Features

* Sparkler's domain is an "Example" object with two string attributes. Sparkler isn't about the domain...it's about demonstrating everything else required to deploy a small but production-ready API.
* Powered by the [Spark Framework](http://sparkjava.com), a Sinatra-inspired simple and lightweight Java web framework built for rapid development.
* Ready for continuous delivery with a fully automated build and release for a versioned standalone distribution.
* Logging configured with Log4j 2, with config file outside of the compiled application allowing redefinition of logging behavior without stopping or redeploying the application.
* JSON parsing with [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson).
* Automated database migrations with [Flyway](flywaydb.org).
* Lightweight SQL to object mapping using [sql2o](http://www.sql2o.org).
* Fast, repeatable fully automated functional testing of the public REST API using JUnit and the [Apache HttpClient](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga).
* Groovy-based REPL for interactive development.
* Conforms to a [twelve-factor SaaS methodology](http://12factor.net) and is ready for deployment to Heroku, AWS, or other PaaS environments.
* TDD-friendly with database migrations applied before each suite and tables cleared before each test case.

### Getting Started

Start the server: `make server`

This starts up the server in the same manner that will be used in the actual release.

Visit the welcome page: http://localhost:8081

See the `makefile` for other automation targets.

### Public API

POST: http://localhost:8081/examples
```
{
  "name" : "foo",
  "type" : "bar"
}
```

GET: http://localhost:8081/examples/1

PUT: http://localhost:8081/examples/1 with JSON as in POST

DELETE: http://localhost:8081/examples/1

See the [functional tests](./src/test/java/com/testedminds/template/RestfulApiFunctionalTest.java) for the full contract with Examples.


### Releasing

#### Update the version in pom.xml

Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) conventions: major.minor.patch

* The RestfulApiFunctionalTest suite defines the contract for the public API. If this API changes in a way that isn't backwards compatible, that's a major version change.
* Bug fixes and refactoring are patch revisions.
* Backwards compatible features are a minor revision.
* Follow the SemVer spec for anything else.

Commit the appropriate version change, then tag the repo:

```
git commit -am "Update version for release"
git push
git tag -a 1.0.0
git push --tags
```

#### Create the release artifact

Let's say we're releasing version 1.0.0.

`make release` will create `target/sparkler-1.0.0.tgz`, a tarball of the `target/sparkler-1.0.0-standalone` directory.

#### Run the release

Untar the release in the location of your choice with `tar xzf sparkler-1.0.0.tgz`:

```
sparkler-1.0.0-standalone/
├── bin      - scripts used to run the application
├── config   - log4j configuration file
└── lib      - all jars needed for the application
```

Switch to the directory where you untarred your distribution: `cd sparkler-1.0.0-standalone`

Run database migrations (assuming a local H2 database for the moment): `bin/migrate.sh jdbc:h2:file:./db/sparkler sa`

Start the service: `bin/server.sh 8081 jdbc:h2:file:./db/sparkler sa`

#### Change the Log4j configuration at runtime (optional)

It can be useful to be able to switch the logging levels of one of the applications sub-systems without shutting down.
Try hitting an invalid url like http://localhost:8081/examples/fubar. Note the WARN message in the logs.

Edit `config/log4j2.xml` to change the com.testedminds logger level to error. Within 30 seconds (or the value you set in monitorInterval), the application will reload the log4j config and you should see a message in the console that the config was modified. Try visiting the invalid url again, and notice how there is now no log entry.

### FAQ

#### make?

Yes. Instead of having a bin directory with a whole bunch of scripts, it's much easier to have a `makefile` with very simple commands that take care of your project's frequently used tasks.

`make` is also already on just about everyone's machine, unless you're on Windows. Even then, it's available.

#### Have you tested developing on Windows?

No. This has been build on OS X Yosemite and El Capitan. YMMV.

#### This is interesting. How can I contribute?

Check the issues and send a PR!
