### What is this template?
  > This is a reference application designed for a Java 8 RESTful API projects. It is based on the simple and lightweight
  [spark](http://sparkjava.com/) micro framework. For the backend, this template uses [flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)
  which is a database migration tool. 
   
### How to run it?
  > This template uses make and maven, you can find the available make commands in the makefile in addition to 
  all the maven commands. To run this template use: "make app", this command will create the database
  and runs the application on port 8081. 
 
### Why make
 >Instead of having a bin directory with a whole bunch of scripts it's much easier to have a make file with 
   very simple commands that takes care of your project release steps
 
### Deployable project
 >You can release this project using command "make release". This will create a gunzip file under "target" directory. 
 You can unzip the file anywhere, run migrate.sh (pass two arguments, url and username, or modify to accept password as well) and service.sh 
 (pass 3 arguments: port, url and username, or modify to accept password as well) and start using the live app.

### Separation of concerns
 > In this template I tried to make the models be as pure as possible, therefore, used the ExampleRow to correspond
  to a row in the database, DAO to access the db, and payload to transfer JSON to Model and vice-versa where needed.
